<h1> AI-heart-disease-predictor </h1>

<h3>📌 Overview</h3>
<h4> The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics. The model is trained by taking dataset from the kaggle.com. At present the model is only trained to predict whether a patient have a heart disease or not but later on many more features can be added to the model such as Diabetes,Blood Pressure and many more diseases. </h4>

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

<h3> Features:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Training of the model by using datasets from kaggle.com</li>

<li>Visualization of Data for better understanding.</li>

<li>Exporting trained model for reuse.</li>

<li>Evaluation of Model with more accuracy and matrics.</li>

<li>Easy to use interface via Jupyter Notebook.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Technologies used to train the model:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Python 3.x --> To write the code.</li>

<li>Numpy,Pandas --> Used for Data handling</li>

<li>Scikit-learn --> Machine learning Algorithms.</li>

<li>Matplotlib, Seaborn --> Used fot visualization of data</li>

<li>Joblib --> Model persistence</li>
</ol>

<h3>Installation</h3>

Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/Diya171/AI-heart-disease-predictor cd Disease_Detector
<br>
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ol type=".">
  <li>Open colab Notebook.</li>
  <li>Run the Disease_Predictor.ipnyb file step by step.</li>
  <li>Train the model and generate predictions.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use of Logistic Reagression and Random Forest:</h3>

It is used to train our model in such a way that it converts the datasets in a format that our model understands and is able to give feedback.

<h3>Future Impact:</h3>
This model can further be trained on various other datasets regarding other dieases and can be used to diagnose disease in patients in an efficent way.
