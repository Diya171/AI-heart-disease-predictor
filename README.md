<h1> AI-heart-disease-predictor </h1>
<h4> This Disease predictor is a learning AI model which predict the disease by taking the information and reports of patients. The model is basically trained by taking dataset from the kagle.com. At present the model is only trained to predict whether a patient have a heart disease or not. But later on we are thinking to add many more features to our model such as Diabetes,Blood Pressure and many more diseases. </h4>

The Full project is made by using PYTHON.

<h3>✈️Features:</h3>

Training of the model by Dataset of heart_disease from kagle.

Visualization of Data for better understanding.

Exporting trained model for reuse.

Evaluation of Model with more accuracy and matrics.

Easy to use interface via Jupyter Notebook.

<h3>🧑‍💻Technologies used to train the model:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Python --> To write the code. we are writing the code in this language coz it is easy to understand and it is very efficient and best for model training.</li>

<li>Numpy,Pandas-->They are the library of Python. They are used to make better tables or list for better understanding of the dataset.</li>

<li>sklearn-->Machine learning Algorithms.</li>

<li>Matplotlib,Seaborn-->Again they are also the library of Python. They enhance the understanding by making beautiful graphs. They are used to visualized the data in a very beautiful way.</li>
</ol>

<h3>⏺️Installation</h3>

Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/Diya171/AI-heart-disease-predictor
cd Disease_Detector
<br>
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

<h3>👤Usage</h3>

<ol type=".">
  <li>Open colab Notebook.</li>
  <li>Run the Disease_Predictor.ipnyb file step by step.</li>
  <li>Train the model and generate predictions.</li>
</ol>

<h3>🌟Use of Logistic Reagression and Random Forest:</h3>

They are basically used to train our model in such a way that it coverts the dataset in a way that our model understands and trained.

<h3>🔮Future Impact:</h3>

This model is a very high and good initiative in the medical line field because from this model we can predict whether a patient is diagonosed by a disease or not. Absolutely in Future we can also make our model much more efficient in such a way that it makes the task easier for doctor. It can also used for learning and enhancing medical skills.
